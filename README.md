# Microsoft Coding Challenge @ Western University

## Problem 1
* First line contains integer N, indicating number of subsequent input lines
* Each input line contains a number of strings
* Find the list of characters repeating amongst strings on a given line
* Output the list of characters in order from 0-9, A-Z, a-z

## Problem 2
* First line contains integer N, indicating the number of integer arrays (one array per input line)
* Each integer array is sorted in increasing order
* Output the missing numbers (in order) for each array

## Problem 3
* The only input line consists of a pattern of colors (red/orange/yellow/green/blue/purple/blank) where each color is delimited by a space
* The output consists of the colors (red/yellow/blue/blank)
* The output can not have 2 consecutive blanks and can not end with a blank

#### Notes
* Purple-blue= red
* Purple – red = blue
* Orange- yellow = red
* Orange – red = yellow
* Green-blue = yellow
* Green-yellow = blue 
* Red-blank = red
* Blue – blank = blue
* Yellow-blank = yellow 
* Yellow-yellow = blank
* Red – red = blank
* Blue – blue = blank
